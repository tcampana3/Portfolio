                <h3>LEGv8 Disassembler for Machine-Level Programming</h3>
                <p>Created a Java-based disassembler to convert binary LEGv8 instructions into assembly language. Managed endianness issues and optimized the process using bitwise operations extensively. Additionally, developed <strong>shell scripts</strong> to automate the build and execution processes, improving reliability and ease of use for the disassembler. This project involved <strong>Java</strong> programming and low-level machine language concepts.</p>

                <h3>Stout List - Custom Doubly Linked List Implementation</h3>
                <p>Developed a specialized doubly linked list, called the Stout List, to handle variable node capacities. Each node in this list can hold multiple elements, allowing for an efficient structure that minimizes memory overhead by reducing the number of node pointers. Implemented complex features including custom iterators for traversing and modifying the list and an insertion sort algorithm for sorting list elements. This project was built in <strong>Java</strong> and involved in-depth work with <strong>AbstractSequentialList</strong> and <strong>ListIterator</strong> interfaces.</p>
